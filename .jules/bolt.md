## 2024-05-03 - Pre-computing complex list rendering data
**Learning:** Complex lists rendering data involving string manipulations, date conversions, and Hijri data lookups within the map loop directly affect React's rendering performance, causing redundant calculations on every render.
**Action:** Use a `useMemo` hook to enrich and pre-calculate all dynamic values for the data array before rendering, ensuring child components (wrapped in `React.memo()`) receive simple, primitive data and re-calculate only when the core data dependency changes.

## 2024-05-20 - Fast Tick Optimization in Countdown Timer
**Learning:** Found a performance bottleneck in the `CountdownTimer.tsx` where the 1-second `setInterval` loop was allocating new `Date` objects and doing heavy string parsing (`parseTimeToSeconds`) to recalculate current time boundaries every single tick.
**Action:** When working with continuous countdown timers, optimize the "hot path" loop by precomputing an absolute timestamp (`targetMs`) when the target changes, reducing the loop's work to simple arithmetic (`targetMs - now.getTime()`).
